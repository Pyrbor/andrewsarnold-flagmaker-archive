This text above the horizontal line is the only thing in this whole repository that was modified, and the rest of it, including the wiki pages, the rest of the README and the files, are not modified in any way or form and are exactly like the last version of the original repository. With that said, this is a repository to archive the now deleted FlagMaker software made by [andewsarnold](https://github.com/andrewsarnold). It is unknown when it was deleted but the only remaining repository in his account is the FlagMaker Jr, a webapp version of the original FlagMaker for those that don't have Windows or can't install the software.

It is also unknown when was FlagMaker originally made, but it was already existing at least (because of the first version) in September 30th, 2013. I made this repo to make sure that this amazing software wouldn't be lost in time, as the only way to use it is by searching some deep and obscure very old reddit threads to find its download link. I found all of this by going to [FlagMaker Jr's repository](https://github.com/andrewsarnold/FlagMaker-Jr) and searching the original URL of the original repository in the Wayback Machine. Luckily someone had saved it before and also saved the releases page and also the download page of the [original download link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201122092539/https://codeload.github.com/andrewsarnold/FlagMaker/tar.gz/v1.7).

Every single detail in this repository, I tried replicating (other than the files, because I found the files) exactly like the original, including the releases page and the wiki. You can check the pages in the Wayback Machine, and I also recommend that to read the release's reddit posts, that are now deleted. One observation is that I only included the latest release on the releases page because I didn't have time to re-make them. In case you want to see them, https://web.archive.org/web/20201122092515/https://github.com/andrewsarnold/FlagMaker/releases.

FlagMaker is a tool to easily create flags without having to use complicated image editors like Inkscape or Photoshop, and includes many different flag elements and emblems. You can create a flag with six different base types and then add as many overlays as you like. You can save your work to a proprietary file format or export to a PNG or SVG file.
